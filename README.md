# Whisper Dictate

A privacy-first, local **speech-to-text and AI cleanup tool** for Windows.  
It uses [faster-whisper](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper) for offline transcription and can optionally send text to a local or remote **OpenAI-compatible endpoint** (such as [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/)) for light cleanup or rewriting.  
It supports a **GUI**, global hotkeys, and automatic pasting into the active window.

## ✨ Features

- **100% local transcription** — no cloud calls  
- **Optional LLM cleanup** via an OpenAI-style endpoint (LM Studio, Ollama, etc.)  
- **Global hotkey** for push-to-talk from any application  
- **Auto-paste** into the focused window (`Ctrl+V`)    
- **GPU or CPU** execution  
- **One-command setup** using [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)  
- **Comprehensive test suite** with coverage reporting
- **Structured logging** to file and console

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone and install

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/whisper-dictate.git
cd whisper-dictate
uv sync
```

### 2. Run (GUI)

```powershell
uv run dictate-gui
```

The GUI provides:

* Model/device selection
* Input-device field
* Optional LLM cleanup section (endpoint, model, API key, temperature, and system prompt)
* **Auto-paste** checkbox and delay setting
* Transcript view with timestamped results

Use **Load model**, then **Register hotkey** (e.g., `CTRL+WIN+G`), and press the hotkey anywhere to dictate.
If "Auto-paste" is enabled, the result pastes automatically into the app you were using.

---

## 🪄 Auto-Paste Behavior

When the **Auto-paste** checkbox (GUI) is enabled:

1. The final text is copied to the clipboard.
2. After a short delay (default 0.15 s), `Ctrl + V` is sent to the active window.

If you toggle recording from inside Word, Notion, VS Code, or a chat window, the cleaned text appears directly where your cursor is.

> Tip: Trigger the hotkey, don't click the GUI button — clicking steals focus and will paste into the GUI itself.

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test suite with coverage:

```powershell
uv sync --dev
uv run pytest
```

Generate HTML coverage report:

```powershell
uv run pytest --cov=whisper_dictate --cov-report=html
```

---

## 🧾 Deployment on Another Machine

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/whisper-dictate.git
cd whisper-dictate
uv sync
uv run dictate-gui
```

If you want to freeze dependency versions for reproducibility:

```powershell
uv lock
uv sync --locked
```

---

## 📦 Create an EXE

Build a standalone Windows executable using the PyInstaller spec:

```powershell
# Using the Makefile (recommended)
USE_UV=1 make build-exe

# Or directly with PyInstaller
uv run pyinstaller packaging/pyinstaller/whisper_dictate_gui.spec --noconfirm
```

The executable will be created in `dist/whisper-dictate-gui/` with all required CUDA DLLs bundled. See [`docs/build.md`](docs/build.md) for detailed build instructions.

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

| Symptom                      | Cause                           | Fix                                    |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Hotkey not working           | Registered from wrong thread    | Fixed in latest build; re-register it  |
| `cudnn_ops64_9.dll missing`  | cuDNN not installed             | Install cuDNN v9 and add to PATH       |
| `int8_float16 not supported` | CPU mode only                   | Use `--compute-type int8`              |
| Nothing pastes               | GUI has focus                   | Trigger with hotkey from target window |
| Audio errors                 | Mic blocked by privacy settings | Enable mic access for desktop apps     |

## 📝 Logging

Logs are written to both:
- **Console** (stderr) — for immediate feedback
- **File** (`~/.whisper_dictate/logs/whisper_dictate.log`) — for debugging

Log levels include DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, and ERROR with timestamps and context.

**Enjoy local, AI-enhanced dictation — fast, private, and cloud-free.**
